            <p>Spring break is upon us, but really, it's a "spring" break. We got hit by a blizzard today, but it hasn't been too bad - aside from a huge fat L trying to walk to Starbucks with snow painfully hitting our faces only to find that my computer was at 7% and there were no outlets at the Starbucks (but really Starbucks?!). </p>
            <p>Last night, we hit up some jazz clubs: Fat Cat, which I've been wanting to go to forever, but ended up being a complete flop (would go again with Kev though to play some pool), and Smalls, which completely changed my life. Jazz - I still don't quite undertand it, but the musicians listen to each other and to themselves in a way that is completely genuine - something that I feel is sadly lacking oftentimes in classical music, especially with musicians in high school/middle school/even younger (Juilliard PreCollege I'm looking at you). Afterwards, I started rewatching La La Land with a friend. That opening scene will never <i>not</i> be magical. Almost slept over but, I think I really need some me time right now... </p>
            <p>Audrey and I also stopped by MoMA during the day. Bitter sweet, because I'm now a complete MoMA enthusiast, sorry Met :) I would love to have a home that's built like the MoMA - where there is not only a lot of art around, but the building itself is a work of art. </p>
            <p>Anyways, I've spent a considerable amount of time over these past 24 hours making this website come to life, and I know that it's a complete "waste" of my time what with Physics midterm and UW P2 due on Monday, but I haven't felt this happy to be working on something in a long time. Like I said earlier, the importance of me time... Will take a break from improving the aesthetics for a while (Flask, you're up next, I think though I honestly don't relaly know what you do), but now at least, it's super easy to write new posts. Back to Physics!</p>
