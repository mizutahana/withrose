            <p>This semester has been… rough to say the least. I don’t know why this semester is worse than last semester - if anything, it should be easier, no? Maybe it’s because I knew that first semester was going to be hard, so relatively speaking, it wasn’t too bad. Maybe it’s because I’ve started my internship. Maybe it’s because I’ve just lost my love of learning. Whatever it is, this semester sucks.</p>
            <p>I keep telling myself I don’t know why I’m doing so badly, but no, I know exactly why. How much time am I spending on everything? Internship: 18 hours. Music: 10 hours. Class time: 20 hours. Project Tutors: 3 hours. CWBS and CJS: 2 hours. So that leaves 115 hours in my week. Put in sleep (lets say 7 hours a night?) and I’m down at 66 hours. Okay but I like sleeping in on weekends. Tack on an extra three hours. 63 hours. I take an hour to get ready in the mornings, so I’m at 56 hours.</p>

            <p>Take that from 56 hours and I am at a grand total of 33 hours. </p>
            <p>Now that’s a lot of hours to do ANYTHING with. I’m planning on spending at least 8 of those hours a week ~improving myself~ lol. Aka reading, writing on this blog, doing some CS… No piano, no schoolwork, no internship work. Those are the only guidelines. </p>
            <p>FUCK I FORGOT ABOUT EATING. YEAH THATS A THING. 3 times a day. 1 hour each? LOL this is where all my hours are disappearing to. That’s 27 hours lol. Okay so if I take that from 34 hours that’s 6 hours. Definitely spend over that procrastinating.</p>
            <p>Now this might be why I’m always feeling dead. And why I always find myself cheating on the psets. Priorities, Hana, priorities. </p>
            <p>I love the things in the first paragraph, so that’s 56 hours in a week. And I NEED to start doing homework so I don’t fail out of school again. I have 33 hours a week to do a lot of what I want to do. Just kidding, I am cutting back on internship. Add back 8 hours, so I’m back at 41 hours. And I really really need those 8 hours that I talked about earlier of “me” time. Back at 33 hours. </p>
            <p>Time to cut down on food time. Let’s say one meal a day I get to eat with a friend. That’s 7 hours (MUCH better than the 21 hours I’m doing now lmao), and for the other meals, I get to spend 20 minutes actually getting the food itself, aka 5 hours a week. 12 hours, still better than 21. So then I’m at 9 hours.</p>
            <p>9 hours of glorious procrastination, with friends or otherwise. So don’t waste those 9 hours.</p>
            <p>Lol okay Hana, time to figure your shit out. </p>
